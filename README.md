Hi!

I'm Niki and I created this web app!

All you have to do is enter the name of your favorite celebrity and my app will return its Instagram account!

A few technicalities:
- Each computer gets its own blob storage in Microsoft Azure (blob name is saved in cookies).
- Whenever a certain computer starts the app, a new blob will be created and start saving info.
- ^ This means that one computer's blob isn't another computer's blob, history is private!
- Your search history shall remain as long as you don't clean your cookies (or as long as my free trial
  of Azure keeps going, of course).

That should be it, thanks for reading and please enjoy my app :)

Wishing you all a magnificent day,
Niki
